# Conway's Game Of Life

John Conway is an acclaimed mathematician and the creator of the cellular automaton Game of Life.
"The "game" is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves, or, for advanced "players", by creating patterns with particular properties." src [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)

Here I have created an animation using Javascript, and HTML that demonstrates Conway's GOL.

### Prerequisites

I used an HTML canvas to illustrate this project, therefore the only prerequisite would be use Google chrome to open conway.html

### Installing

After cloning or downloading this repo you may simple double click the conway.html file and the page should open in the browser or from the local directory

```
$ open conway.html
```
It's as simple as that. Please enjoy and offer any feedback
